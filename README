Motivation
==========

Ever tried to get faster at coding and found yourself getting bogged down on 
the learning curve as you try to improve your skills? Ever wanted to see just
how blindingly fast you can hack code? I did- and I needed a project so
simple that even a novice could do it. 

Umpteen weeks later I have come to realise two things- Pacman is a 
surprisingly complicated and subtle game. And I will never blame a publisher
for delaying a release due to game tuning again. 

That takes time and passion.


Features
========

- nice scaling video 'emulation' style
- fast and responseive
- sound

============

- cmake
- libraries
  - boost
  - opengl
